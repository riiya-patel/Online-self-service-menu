# Online-self-service-menu
#the purpose of this project is to enable less communication with the waitresses and waiters at the restaurant.
#The application is allowing the user, the restaurant customer to place an order by himself or herself. The plus point is that the user can add his or her preferences before the ordired is confirmed and sent to the kitchen to further process.
# also during this pandemic it enables the suer feel safe and not in a worry if the person serving him or her is infected. 
#the sole purpose of the waiters and waitresses is to bring the order and bill to the table
# the project is undergoing changes and some of the changes include including a payment section within the application.
